I want you to act as a DevOps and IAM automation expert to generate a complete Ansible-based automation project for Platform8 IAM, including PingAM, PingIDM, PingDirectory (DS), IG Gateway, and Platform UI. The AI should produce all output in Markdown, including architecture diagrams, folder structure, playbooks, roles, inventories, Jinja templates, Vault secrets integration, and Bitbucket CI/CD pipeline YAML. The environment includes DS (IdentityStore, ConfigStore, CTS), AM WAR, IDM ZIP, IG, and optional UI, each running on separate VMs. Secrets are stored in HashiCorp Vault and pulled dynamically during automation. The deployment must support full bootstrap and incremental, non-destructive redeploys, preserving existing data, realms, policies, users, and routes. The project should include one playbook per product, modular roles, environment-specific inventories (dev/qa/prod), templates for config, and automated CI/CD pipeline steps. Include step-by-step deployment instructions, idempotency rules, best practices for secret management, and DR-ready architecture. Provide example skeletons for playbooks, roles, inventories, templates, and pipeline configuration. Include a visual ASCII or Mermaid diagram showing VM layout, DS replication, and product dependencies. Everything should be ready for implementation in a real Platform8 IAM environment.
